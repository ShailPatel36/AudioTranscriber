  - Use Redux or Context API for handling user session data, file upload state, transcription progress, and error messaging

- **UI/UX Libraries:**  
  - Material UI, Tailwind CSS, or a similar framework to implement a polished design

### **Backend Architecture**

- **Entry Point:**  
  - Main server file (e.g., `server.js` or `app.js`) initializes Express.js server

- **Routing & Controllers:**  
  - **Authentication Routes:** For user registration, login, and session validation  
  - **File Upload Routes:** Handle MP3/video file submissions (using Multer or equivalent)  
  - **Transcription Routes:**  
    - Process uploaded files and YouTube links  
    - Integrate with transcription services (wrap API calls for Free-Scribe, Deepgram, or Picovoice Cheetah)  
  - **History Routes:** Retrieve and manage user transcription records

- **Middleware:**  
  - File upload processing (Multer)  
  - Authentication and error handling  
  - Request parsing (body-parser, etc.)

- **Database Models:**  
  - User schema with authentication details  
  - Transcription records with metadata, timestamps, and file references

- **External Service Integration:**  
  - Create service modules to interact with transcription APIs  
  - Handle YouTube API calls to extract audio from provided URLs
